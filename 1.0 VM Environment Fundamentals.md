## 1.1 Explain why isolated VMs are used for forensic analysis (safety, repeatability, integrity)

- Isolation is a control mechanism. Forensic work assumes the evidence may contain active malware, exploit triggers, or files that behave differently when opened than when stored. A VM gives you a boundary so mistakes do not spread to your host OS, your personal files, or your enterprise network. The correct mindset is "contain first, analyze second." If you cannot contain it, you cannot safely inspect it.

- Repeatability is the operational reason teams use VMs. You want a consistent workstation image with consistent tools, consistent settings, and consistent outputs. That means your teammate can run the same steps and validate your results. It also means you can revisit a case weeks later and re-create a finding without reinventing your environment. The VM gives you a known-good baseline and an easy reset button.

- Integrity is the credibility reason. Your conclusions need to survive scrutiny. You preserve originals, analyze copies, and keep a clear record of what changed and when. A VM supports this by letting you revert state between cases, separate evidence storage from tool output, and avoid "ambient writes" caused by OS services. The VM does not guarantee integrity by itself. You still need read-only mounts, hash verification, careful exports, and disciplined documentation.

## 1.2 Differentiate host vs guest components and resource boundaries (CPU, RAM, disk, network)

- The host controls the physical resources. The guest consumes virtual resources carved out of the host. The guest sees a vCPU count, a RAM allocation, virtual disks, and virtual network adapters, but those are abstractions. The host schedules CPU time, decides when memory is actually available, and performs the underlying disk and network I/O.

- That boundary matters because forensic workloads are resource-intensive and sensitive to bottlenecks. Disk I/O is often the limiting factor during ingest, indexing, timeline creation, and bulk export. Memory pressure in the guest causes paging, which slows artifact parsing and can make tools appear unreliable. CPU contention can change runtime behavior and make long-running jobs time out. Network boundaries are the highest risk because a misconfigured adapter can put your analysis VM on a real LAN and allow unwanted traffic, scanning, or beaconing.

- A useful mental model is: the host is the safety perimeter and the performance ceiling. The guest is the controlled workspace where you do the analysis. If the host is misconfigured or overloaded, the guest becomes unstable and your analysis becomes harder to defend.

## 1.3 Configure VM networking for analysis (host-only preferred; NAT controlled; bridged avoided)

- Default to no external connectivity. Most forensic tasks do not require internet access. Host-only networking is the standard safe choice because it prevents the guest from reaching the internet and prevents the internet from reaching the guest. It also reduces the chance of accidental beaconing if something executes or if a tool touches a malicious script.

- Use NAT only when you must, and treat it as a temporary state. Legit reasons include installing tools, pulling symbol files, validating a hash against a trusted source, or retrieving documentation. In those moments, enable NAT, do the task, record the time window in your notes, then disable it. This keeps the operational risk bounded and supports later explanations of why the VM had network access.
	- You shouldn't really ever need to install more tools onto the VM. 

- Avoid bridged networking for analysis. Bridging places the VM directly on the same network as other hosts, which is the worst default for unknown content. 
## 1.4 Explain snapshot concepts and apply a safe snapshot workflow (baseline, pre-lab, revert, branch)

- Snapshots provide time travel. They capture VM disk state and sometimes memory state, depending on the hypervisor and settings. Under the hood, most snapshot systems create a delta chain. The base disk remains unchanged and new writes go into snapshot files. This makes it easy to roll back, but it also creates risk if you pile up long chains that become large, slow, or fragile.

- A safe workflow starts with a baseline snapshot. Build the VM, patch it, configure tools, verify settings, then snapshot it as "baseline-clean." This is your reference state. Before any evidence touches the VM, take a "pre-lab" snapshot. This is your clean starting point for case work. For each case, branch from pre-lab with a snapshot named by case ID and date, and avoid mixing multiple cases in a single branch.
	- A clean snapshot is already provided in the VM provided. Just revert back to that one, but feel free to create more images as you go.

- Revert is your hygiene step. When the case is complete, export what you need, verify hashes of exports, then revert to pre-lab. This prevents residue from one case influencing another. It also reduces the chance that a misstep, tool setting, or accidental execution persists into future work.

## 1.5 Configure data transfer controls (shared folders, clipboard, drag-and-drop) and describe the safest method to import images into the workstation

- Data transfer features are the usual place isolation fails. Shared folders, clipboard sharing, and drag-and-drop are convenient, but they create uncontrolled pathways between host and guest. They increase the chance of accidental execution, accidental leakage, and accidental contamination. They also make it harder to prove that evidence remained controlled because the boundary is porous.

- Lock down transfer paths by default. Disable shared folders unless a specific workflow requires them. Disable clipboard sharing and drag-and-drop. If policy allows, treat the guest as a dead-end environment that only receives evidence through a controlled intake method and only emits exports through a controlled packaging method.

- We will use a shared, read only folder, to transport the image from your actual computer into the VM.  

- Hashes of all images should be taken before, and should be hashed again when they are within the VM to ensure integrity. 

## 1.6 Identify common evidence and VM disk formats (E01, RAW/dd, VMDK, VHD/VHDX) and their use cases

- Evidence formats represent collected data. VM disk formats represent virtual storage. They overlap in tooling, but they serve different purposes, and mixing them up creates sloppy handling.

- E01 is a forensic container format often used for disk acquisitions. It commonly supports segmentation and metadata, and many forensic tools treat it as a first-class evidence format. 
- RAW/dd is a raw sector-by-sector copy. It is straightforward and widely supported, but large and without container features. 
	- You typically choose between them based on collection tooling, transfer constraints, and what your analysis tools mount cleanly.
	
- VMDK is a VMware virtual disk format. VHD and VHDX are Hyper-V formats, with VHDX generally being newer and more capable for large disks. You will encounter these in two common ways: the VM disk itself becomes evidence (a suspect VM), or you need to convert between formats for compatibility with mount tools. The key practice is to keep an original evidence image immutable, and perform any conversions on verified copies, with hashes recorded before and after.

## 1.7 Configure time settings and explain time sync risks (timeline integrity, clock drift)

- Time is the backbone of timeline analysis. If your analysis environment handles time inconsistently, it can quietly corrupt your interpretation. VMs can drift. Hypervisors can force-correct guest clocks. Time zone settings can shift event interpretation by hours. DST changes can create missing or duplicated hours. Those issues can turn a clean sequence of events into an apparent contradiction.

- You reduce this risk by standardizing how you represent time. Use UTC (zulu) as the reference point for notes, reporting, and correlation across sources. Know the mental math to correlate this to local time where 

- Also separate two concepts: the time in the evidence and the time in your workstation. The evidence timestamps are what you are interpreting. Your workstation clock should be stable and documented so your notes and exports have reliable timestamps. When you export artifacts, record the export time in UTC and the hash of the exported files so later reviewers can validate what you produced and when.

## 1.8 Tune VM performance settings (vCPU, RAM, storage, indexing) and troubleshoot common failures (mount errors, storage growth, isolation failures)

- Performance tuning is about stability and predictability. Many tools fail when the real problem is resource starvation. These tools are hungry. Start with a reasonable configuration and adjust based on what you observe. If ingest and indexing take forever, look at disk I/O first. If tools freeze or crash during parsing, look at RAM and paging. If everything is slow while CPU is low, look at storage latency or host contention.

- On kit laptops, it would be ideal if we can allocate a minimum of 16-32gb of memory to the VM alone.

- For vCPU, avoid extremes. Too few cores can bottleneck parsing and indexing. Too many cores can reduce scheduling efficiency on a busy host. Allocate enough RAM to keep large parses and timelines in memory without paging. For storage, keep the VM and case workspace on fast SSD storage and monitor free disk space. For indexing, disable host indexing on evidence and case directories so background services do not touch evidence paths or create noise in access patterns.

- Common failures follow patterns. Mount errors often come from wrong tool choice, wrong mount mode, unsupported image types, missing partitions, or encryption like BitLocker. Storage growth failures come from thin-provisioned disks, runaway snapshot chains, and large ingest outputs that fill the host drive. Isolation failures come from settings drift: shared folders get re-enabled, clipboard sharing returns, or a network adapter gets switched to bridged. Your corrective action should be a repeatable pre-flight checklist: verify networking mode, verify sharing features are off, verify snapshot state, verify free disk space, verify read-only mount settings, then begin analysis.
