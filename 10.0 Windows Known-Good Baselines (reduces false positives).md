## 10.1 Identify common normal-but-scary binaries (svchost, rundll32, regsvr32, msiexec, wmi providers)

- Why these matter
  - They are legitimate Windows components.
  - Attackers abuse them because they blend in and are already trusted by many controls.
- Common "normal-but-scary" examples
  - `svchost.exe`
    - Normal: hosts Windows services; usually runs from `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`
    - Suspicious when: wrong path, weird parent, unusual service group, outbound network from unexpected service context
  - `rundll32.exe`
    - Normal: loads and runs DLL exports; typically `C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe`
    - Suspicious when: command line points to user-writable paths, odd DLL names, unusual parent (Office apps, browsers) without explanation
  - `regsvr32.exe`
    - Normal: registers COM DLLs; typically System32 path
    - Suspicious when: used to execute scripts/remote content patterns or launched with odd flags near the intrusion window
  - `msiexec.exe`
    - Normal: Windows Installer service; installs MSI packages; typically System32 path
    - Suspicious when: silent installs from user space, unusual MSI sources, odd parents, repeated execution without matching software install story
  - WMI-related components (providers and tooling)
    - Normal: WMI is used heavily by Windows and admin tools
    - Suspicious when: persistent WMI subscriptions appear, unusual consumers, scripts/binaries executed via WMI outside admin context

## 10.2 Explain LOLBins at a high level and how to verify misuse using context (cmdline, parent, path, persistence)

- Definition
  - LOLBins are legitimate, signed Windows binaries that can be used for malicious goals.
  - Abuse works because the binary is trusted; the behavior is the problem.
- Why novices get burned
  - Seeing a LOLBin name alone is not evidence.
  - Context determines whether it is normal admin activity or misuse.
- How to verify misuse (context checks)
  - Command line
    - Look for encoded payloads, download-and-execute chains, suspicious scripts, or odd arguments
    - Prefer full command line capture over truncated views
  - Parent process
    - Check what launched it and whether that parent makes sense (Explorer vs Office vs service host)
    - Look for unusual chains (Word -> PowerShell -> rundll32)
  - Path legitimacy
    - Confirm the binary is running from the expected Windows directory, not a lookalike in user space
  - Persistence linkage
    - Determine whether the LOLBin invocation is triggered by a service/task/Run key/WMI subscription
  - Time alignment
    - Correlate execution with the suspected incident window and user activity
- Confidence rule
  - A LOLBin name is a lead.
  - LOLBin name + suspicious command line + suspicious parent/path/persistence = evidence.

## 10.3 Explain common benign triggers for YARA/entropy hits (installers, compressed archives, legitimate packed apps)

- Why false positives happen
  - Many legitimate files are packed, compressed, or encrypted by design.
  - YARA rules can match shared components or generic patterns.
  - Entropy is a "packed-ness" indicator, not a "maliciousness" indicator.
- Common benign high-entropy sources
  - Installers and updaters (MSI bundles, vendor updaters, self-extracting archives)
  - Browsers and security products (large packed binaries, frequent updates)
  - Legit commercial software with protectors/packers (DRM, licensing enforcement)
  - Compressed archives (zip/7z/rar) and media files
- Common benign YARA triggers
  - Packer signatures (UPX-like patterns, generic stubs)
  - Shared libraries embedded in many applications
  - Developer toolchains and remote admin utilities (dual-use tools)
- How to reduce noise in practice
  - Anchor to baselines: expected software inventory, expected install paths, expected publishers
  - Correlate tool hits with real-world evidence:
    - persistence entries
    - execution artifacts
    - suspicious location and timing
  - Maintain an allowlist of known benign recurring hits for your environment (with hashes and rationale)
