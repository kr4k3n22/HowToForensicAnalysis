## 11.1 Understand what you are looking at (roles and data flows)
- Big picture
  - ICS environments run physical processes (power, water, fuel, manufacturing).
  - IT priorities often optimize confidentiality first. ICS priorities often optimize safety and availability first.
- Common components and how they relate
  - Field devices (sensors/actuators) feed data to controllers.
  - Controllers execute logic and drive outputs.
  - Operator systems visualize and control the process.
  - Supervisory systems coordinate and log.

## 11.2 Identify common ICS/SCADA system types in an image (quick fingerprinting)
- HMI (Human-Machine Interface)
  - Purpose: operator view/control of the process.
  - Typical clues:
    - Windows-based workstation or panel PC is common.
    - HMI vendor software, project files, tags, alarm configs, and screen graphics.
    - Local databases or flat files for alarms, trends, user actions.
- SCADA server (supervisory layer)
  - Purpose: centralized supervision, alarm management, data collection, and control coordination.
  - Typical clues:
    - Server-class OS (often Windows Server; sometimes Linux).
    - Services for polling/collecting, alarm/event management, and OPC components.
    - Large configuration databases and tag lists.
- PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
  - Purpose: real-time control logic close to the process.
  - Typical clues (disk images vary widely):
    - Often not Windows. Frequently embedded Linux, RTOS, or vendor firmware.
    - Minimal filesystem, specialized partitions, config blobs, ladder logic/function block artifacts.
    - Vendor-specific project or runtime files and boot images.
- RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) / IED (Intelligent Electronic Device)
  - Purpose: remote monitoring/control or electrical protection/automation.
  - Typical clues:
    - Embedded firmware layouts, small partitions, serial/network config, protocol stacks.
    - Configuration exports may be more valuable than "files" in the usual sense.
- Embedded system / appliance (gateway, switch, firewall, protocol converter)
  - Purpose: translate protocols, route traffic, enforce boundaries, or bridge serial to IP.
  - Typical clues:
    - BusyBox-style Linux filesystem, read-only rootfs, overlayfs, packed firmware images.
    - Startup scripts, network configs, certificates, VPN configs, protocol gateway configs.
- Data historian
  - Purpose: time-series storage for process data (tags, trends, long-term retention).
  - Typical clues:
    - Large time-series data stores, archives, compression files, and index databases.
    - Collector/agent configs, tag definitions, retention policies.
    - High volume of data with strong time ordering.
- Engineering workstation
  - Purpose: programming and maintaining PLC/RTU/HMI projects.
  - Typical clues:
    - Vendor engineering tools, project directories, backups, and export bundles.
    - Firmware packages, device catalogs, offline copies of logic, and change logs.
    - USB/removable media artifacts are common due to field workflows.

## 11.3 Core terms that matter during triage (so analysts speak the same language)
- Tag
  - Named data point representing a sensor value, setpoint, status bit, or calculation.
- Alarm/event
  - Alarm: condition requiring attention (threshold exceeded, equipment fault).
  - Event: logged occurrence (operator action, state change, system message).
- Recipe / batch / sequence
  - Stored parameters and steps that drive a repeatable process run.
- OPC (classic) / OPC UA
  - Common interoperability layers between control systems and applications.
  - Clues show up as clients/servers, certificates (OPC UA), and connector configs.
- Control network vs business network
  - Control side often uses specialized protocols and strict segmentation (in mature shops).
  - Images may include artifacts showing bridging, remote access, or weak boundaries.

## 11.4 What changes in your triage approach for ICS images (practical differences)
- Availability and safety context changes how you interpret artifacts
  - Some "weird" services exist for uptime and legacy compatibility.
  - Patching and antivirus posture may be weaker by design or constraint.
- Expect legacy and vendor-specific structure
  - Older OS versions and unsupported toolchains are common.
  - Vendor software may store critical configs in proprietary formats.
- Treat configuration as crown jewels
  - Logic, tag databases, alarm configs, and historian definitions can matter more than user documents.
  - Exports and project backups are often the fastest way to understand the environment.

## 11.5 High-value artifacts to prioritize in ICS/SCADA images
- Operator and engineering activity
  - Operator action logs, engineering tool project changes, program downloads/uploads.
- System configuration
  - Tag databases, alarm/trend definitions, OPC configs, protocol gateway settings.
- Remote access and trust
  - VPN clients, remote admin tools, SSH keys, RDP configs, shared accounts, local admin groups.
  - Certificates and keys used for OPC UA, TLS, VPN, or device auth.
- Network and protocol context
  - Interface configs, routing, firewall rules, and any protocol converter/gateway configs.
  - Logs indicating connections to PLCs/RTUs, polling intervals, and endpoint lists.
- Backups and exports
  - Vendor project backups, configuration exports, firmware bundles, golden images.
  - These often provide a clearer view than raw runtime directories.

## 11.6 Common pitfalls and how to avoid them (ICS-specific)
- Mislabeling roles
  - An HMI can look like a normal Windows workstation until you find the HMI runtime and tag project.
  - A historian can look like "just a big database server" unless you recognize time-series archives and collectors.
- Assuming normal IT baselines apply
  - Legacy OS, unsigned binaries, and odd services can be normal in ICS.
  - Promote to "suspicious" only with context: path anomalies, persistence abuse, or unauthorized tooling.
- Breaking forensic value by ignoring time
  - Historian and alarm/event data are time critical.
  - Normalize to UTC in your notes and keep original timezone context recorded.

## 11.7 Minimal "what to report" fields when you think it is ICS/SCADA
- Device/system role (HMI, SCADA server, historian, engineering workstation, gateway, embedded appliance)
- Vendor/product identifiers (from installed software, services, config dirs)
- Primary data sources/targets (PLC/RTU endpoints, OPC servers, collectors)
- High-value configs found (tag DB, alarm config, recipes, project files)
- Remote access pathways present (VPN, RDP, SSH, vendor remote tools)
- Any evidence of unauthorized change (new users, altered projects, new services/tasks, modified configs)
