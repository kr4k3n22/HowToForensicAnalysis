## 3.1 Apply read-only analysis principles (mount read-only, preserve originals, minimize writes)

- Treat the original evidence as immutable.
  - Do not work directly out of the "evidence master" location.
  - Create verified working copies when you must transform, ingest, or export.
- Mount images read-only whenever possible.
  - Prefer tools and workflows that enforce read-only at the mount layer.
  - Verify the mount is read-only before browsing or exporting.
- Minimize writes inside the evidence path.
  - Keep tool output in `work/` or `exports/`, never in `evidence/`.
  - Disable indexing on evidence directories to avoid background reads/writes.
- Keep the VM environment stable.
  - Use a clean snapshot before touching evidence.
  - Revert after each case to avoid cross-case contamination.

## 3.2 Explain hashing (MD5/SHA256) and perform hash verification using common tooling (FTK Imager, Autopsy, Arsenal workflows)

- Hashing proves identity, not intent.
  - A matching hash means the bytes match exactly.
  - A mismatch means something changed or you compared the wrong file.
- Use SHA256 as the primary integrity hash when available.
  - Use MD5 only for compatibility and quick reference, not as your sole control. MD5 is considered **deprecated**.
- Hash at every transition point.
  - When evidence is received (initial verification).
  - After copying into the case workspace (copy validation).
  - After exports are created (export integrity).
- Store hashes in a dedicated manifest file.
  - Keep the manifest under `hashes/`.
  - Record algorithm, filename, size, acquisition time, and who computed it.
- Tooling expectations (workflow-level).
  - FTK Imager: quick hash compute and verification during preview/export.
  - Arsenal-type workflows: validate the mounted volume is read-only and hash exported files.
  - Autopsy: document ingest settings and separately hash critical exports you hand off.

## 3.3 Explain chain-of-custody essentials (what must be recorded, minimum documentation)

- Chain-of-custody is a record of control.
  - Who had the evidence.
  - When they had it.
  - What they did with it.
  - Where it was stored.
- Minimum documentation to maintain defensibility.
  - Case ID and evidence ID.
  - Source of evidence (system name, image type, acquisition method if known).
  - Date/time received, by whom, and from whom.
  - Hash values (at receipt and after any copies).
  - Storage location(s) and access controls.
  - Every transfer event: time, person, method, and reason.
- Keep notes operational, not narrative.
  - Record actions, tools, settings, and results.
  - Avoid assumptions phrased as facts.

## 3.4 Identify and prevent evidence contamination in a VM (accidental execution, indexing writes, metadata alteration, tool output mixing)

- Common contamination vectors to prevent.
  - Accidental execution by double-clicking, previewing, or opening active documents.
  - Background indexing and thumbnail generation touching evidence files.
  - Antivirus quarantine actions modifying or deleting items in the workspace.
  - Tool output written into evidence directories.
  - Mixing exports from multiple cases into the same folder.
- Controls that reduce contamination risk.
  - Disable shared folders, clipboard sync, and drag-and-drop by default.
  - Set evidence folders to no-index and do not browse them with "helpful" preview panes.
  - Use explicit case folder structure with strict separation:
    - `evidence/` (read-only, no outputs)
    - `work/` (tool databases and scratch)
    - `exports/` (deliverables only)
  - Label and quarantine suspicious extracted binaries separately.
- Validation checks.
  - Re-hash key items after transfers and before handoff.
  - Confirm timestamps and sizes did not change in the evidence master path.

## 3.5 Normalize time to GMT/UTC and explain how time zone and DST errors break timelines

- Use UTC as the analysis reference time.
  - Record all analyst actions in UTC in notes and logs.
  - Convert artifact times to UTC for correlation across sources.
- Why time normalization matters.
  - Different artifacts store time differently (local time, UTC, file system time).
  - Cross-host investigations fail when each system is interpreted in its own local time.
- Common failure modes.
  - DST transitions create duplicate or missing hours, breaking ordering.
  - Wrong time zone assumptions shift events by hours, creating false causality.
  - VM time sync corrections during analysis create confusing "now" timestamps in logs.
- Practical controls.
  - Document the system time zone from the evidence (when known).
  - Document your workstation time zone and conversion rules.
  - When presenting timelines, state the time basis explicitly (UTC) and note any conversions.
