## 4.1 Differentiate mounting, previewing, ingesting, and exporting evidence (what changes, what does not)

- Mounting
  - Purpose: expose volumes/filesystems from an image so you can browse and extract.
  - What should not change: the evidence bytes in the image.
  - What can change: your VM state and tool logs; mount cache files depending on tool.
  - Key control: enforce read-only at the mount layer.
- Previewing
  - Purpose: quick visibility into directory structure and targeted artifacts without full parsing.
  - What should not change: evidence bytes.
  - What can change: tool-side metadata (bookmarks, export logs) and analyst notes.
  - Risk: "helpful" UI behaviors can trigger previews of active content if you are careless.
- Ingesting
  - Purpose: full case workflow where a tool parses artifacts, builds indexes, and creates timelines.
  - What should not change: evidence bytes.
  - What does change: a tool database is created in your `work/` directory and can be large.
  - Tradeoff: slower upfront, faster hunting later due to parsing and searchability.
- Exporting
  - Purpose: copy files/artifacts out of evidence into your controlled workspace for reporting/handoff.
  - What should not change: evidence bytes.
  - What must be controlled: naming, destination directories, hashing, and documentation.
  - Key rule: exports are derived artifacts and must be hash-tracked and traceable to source paths.

## 4.2 Mount disk images read-only using Arsenal Image Mounter and validate volume access

- Use read-only mounts as the default for disk images.
  - Confirm the tool is set to read-only before mounting.
  - Prefer mounting as a physical disk/volume that other tools can read without writing.
- Validate volume access after mount.
  - Confirm partitions and volumes appear as expected.
  - Verify file system type and volume labels match what you expect.
  - Spot-check directories to confirm content is readable.
- Document mount context.
  - Record image name, mount method, read-only setting, and assigned drive letters/volume IDs.
  - Record any errors or warnings at mount time.

## 4.3 Preview images and export artifacts using FTK Imager (hashes, file export, quick triage)

- Use FTK Imager for fast triage and targeted exports.
  - Quickly inspect directory structure, key files, and metadata without full ingest.
- Export discipline.
  - Export into `exports/` with clean naming and source-path references.
  - Hash exported items (SHA256 primary; MD5 if needed for compatibility).
  - Keep an export log: what you exported, from where, and why.
- Quick triage patterns.
  - Identify likely user profiles and relevant time windows first.
  - Pull high-signal artifacts early (logs, registry hives, suspicious executables, scripts).
  - Avoid opening potentially active content directly in the VM.

## 4.4 Create a case and ingest evidence using Autopsy (artifact parsing, timelines, tagging)
- Use Autopsy when you need structured hunting and correlation.
  - Build timelines.
  - Parse common artifacts automatically.
  - Tag items and create case notes tied to evidence locations.
- Ingest planning.
  - Choose modules intentionally to balance speed and completeness.
  - Store Autopsy case databases in `work/`, not in `evidence/`.
  - Expect storage growth; ensure sufficient disk space before ingest.
- Workflow strengths.
  - Search across parsed artifacts and file content (where applicable).
  - Pivot from a hit to related artifacts (user, time, path, file relationships).
  - Maintain structured tagging for reporting and handoff.

## 4.5 Select Arsenal vs FTK vs Autopsy based on the analysis question (speed vs depth vs case workflow)
- Choose Arsenal when the priority is fast, safe access to volumes.
  - Best for mounting read-only and enabling other tools to operate on the mounted volume.
  - Good when you already know what you need and want minimal overhead.
  - Mounts the image as a windows drive on your system.
  - **We only have the free arsenal image mounter, which can't open admin directories. If it could, I wouldn't even really teach FTK and Arsenal.**
- Choose FTK Imager when the priority is quick preview and targeted export.
  - Best for rapid triage, hash verification, and pulling specific artifacts.
  - Good when you need speed and operator-driven selection.
  - **Less interactive GUI, but can parse admin directories**
- Choose Autopsy when the priority is depth and correlation.
  - Best for timeline-driven investigations and broad artifact parsing.
  - Good when you need case management, tagging, and repeatable investigative structure.
  - **Can be really, really slow to parse and index an image, but helps with context**
## 4.6 Identify common failure modes (BitLocker/encryption, corrupted volumes, missing partitions, VM snapshot chain issues)
- Encryption / BitLocker
  - Volumes may appear but be unreadable without keys.
  - Expect limited visibility until you obtain lawful/authorized decryption material.
- Corrupted volumes or partial acquisitions
  - Mount may fail or file systems may appear inconsistent.
  - Tools may disagree on partition layout depending on damage.
- Missing partitions / unusual layouts
  - GPT/MBR issues, hidden partitions, or vendor recovery partitions can confuse mounts.
  - Some images contain only a partition, not an entire disk, changing expectations.
- VM snapshot chain issues
  - Long snapshot chains can cause disk errors, slow mounts, and unexpected failures.
  - Thin-provisioned disks can fill the host drive and break ingest/mount operations.
- Tool-mode mistakes
  - Accidental read-write mounting.
  - Exporting into the wrong directory (evidence vs work vs exports).

## 4.7 Compare advantages and disadvantages of each tool in your environment
- Decision lens: safety, speed, depth, operator effort, and reproducibility.

### 4.7.1 Arsenal (free): fast mounting, strong read-only workflow, limited advanced parsing
- Advantages
  - Fast read-only mounting with a workflow that supports evidence integrity.
  - Enables other tools to operate against mounted volumes.
  - Low overhead compared to full ingest tools.
- Disadvantages
  - Limited built-in artifact parsing and correlation.
  - Requires external tools and analyst skill for deeper interpretation.
  - Mount success depends on image type and encryption state.

### 4.7.2 FTK Imager: strong preview/export/hash workflows, manual parsing burden, operator skill dependent
- Advantages
  - Excellent for quick preview, targeted export, and hash verification.
  - Good for early triage when you need specific artifacts fast.
  - Works well alongside a read-only mount workflow.
- Disadvantages
  - Minimal automated parsing and correlation.
  - Results depend heavily on analyst decisions and experience.
  - Easy to miss artifacts if the triage plan is weak.

### 4.7.3 Autopsy: context-driven hunting and timelines, heavier ingest time and resource demand
- Advantages
  - Strong case workflow: ingest, parse, search, timeline, tag, and report.
  - Enables pivots across users, time, paths, and parsed artifacts.
  - Better for investigations where you do not yet know what matters.
- Disadvantages
  - Ingest can be slow and storage-heavy.
  - Module selection affects completeness and false positives.
  - Requires disciplined case management to keep outputs organized and defensible.
