## 5.1.1 Identify key Windows artifact categories and where they reside (event logs, registry hives, user artifacts)

- Event logs (Windows Eventing)
  - Location: `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\`
  - High-value logs: Security, System, Application, PowerShell/Operational (if enabled), TaskScheduler/Operational (if enabled)
  - Use cases: authentication events, service installs, scheduled task activity, system changes
- Registry hives (system-wide and per-user)
  - System hives (typical paths):
    - `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`
    - `C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM`
    - `C:\Windows\System32\config\SOFTWARE`
    - `C:\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY`
  - User hives (per profile):
    - `C:\Users\<user>\NTUSER.DAT`
    - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat`
  - Use cases: persistence keys, installed software, user activity, recently accessed items, shellbags
- User profile artifacts (high-signal locations)
  - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\` (user-level app configs, some persistence)
  - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\` (caches, local app data, browser stores)
  - `C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\` (initial delivery and staging patterns)
  - `C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\` (operator staging, exfil bundles, scripts)
  - Browser data stores (varies by browser; typically under `AppData\Local`)
- File system metadata and execution artifacts (common areas)
  - Prefetch (if enabled): `C:\Windows\Prefetch\`
  - LNK/Jump Lists (per user): under `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\` and related paths
  - Scheduled tasks: `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\` plus registry/task cache artifacts
  - Services and drivers: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\` and service configuration in registry

## 5.1.2 Identify common persistence locations (services, scheduled tasks, Run keys, startup folders, WMI)

- Services (often used for persistent execution with SYSTEM context)
  - Indicators: new or modified service entries, unusual image paths, odd service names, non-standard directories
  - Common storage: service configuration in `SYSTEM` hive; binaries often in user-writable or temp locations when suspicious
- Scheduled Tasks (common for stealthy and reliable persistence)
  - Indicators: tasks created near incident time, tasks with odd triggers, tasks launching from user-writable paths
  - Common storage: task definitions under `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\` and task cache artifacts
- Run keys and RunOnce keys (classic user/system persistence)
  - Indicators: entries pointing to non-standard paths, scripts, renamed binaries, living-off-the-land launchers
  - Common locations: HKLM and HKCU Run/RunOnce paths in registry
- Startup folders (simple, often noisy persistence)
  - Indicators: new shortcuts or binaries placed in startup paths
  - Common locations: per-user Startup and all-users Startup folders
- WMI event subscriptions (powerful, often overlooked persistence)
  - Indicators: new event filters/consumers/bindings, unusual command lines or scripts
  - Stored in WMI repository; typically discovered via specialized tooling and correlation, not casual browsing

## 5.1.3 Explain how ingest scope and indexing choices affect speed, completeness, and false positives (Autopsy modules)

- Ingest scope defines what the tool touches.
  - Broad scope increases completeness but costs time, disk space, and analyst attention.
  - Narrow scope speeds triage but risks missing key artifacts.
- Indexing choices change both performance and results.
  - Content indexing and keyword search add overhead and storage growth.
  - Artifact parsing modules can surface high-value findings quickly but can also generate noise.
- False positives grow when you parse everything without a plan.
  - "Normal Windows" behavior can look suspicious out of context.
  - Generic hits (strings, entropy, YARA) require correlation, not immediate conclusions.
- Practical selection strategy.
  - Start with modules that support the question you are answering (timeframe, persistence, execution, network clues).
  - Avoid enabling every module by default for every case.
  - Treat ingest settings as part of the case record and document them.

## 5.1.4 Apply safe export and quarantine practices for extracted artifacts and binaries (clean naming, isolation, hashing)

- Export rules that prevent confusion and contamination.
  - Export only into `exports/` (deliverables) or `work/` (analysis outputs), never into `evidence/`.
  - Use consistent naming that preserves context: `<case_id>_<hostname>_<user>_<artifact>_<date>_<hashprefix>`
  - Keep an export log that includes original source path and reason for export.
- Quarantine handling for suspicious items.
  - Store suspicious binaries and scripts in a dedicated quarantine subfolder.
  - Do not open or execute from quarantine.
  - Disable indexing and previews for quarantine directories.
- Hashing and traceability.
  - Compute SHA256 for every exported suspicious file and for key artifacts used in conclusions.
  - Store hash manifests under `hashes/` and reference them in notes and handoff packages.
- Packaging hygiene.
  - Bundle related exports with a short README that states:
    - source paths, timestamps observed, and why the item matters
    - what tool extracted it and what settings were used
  - Use password-protected archives if required by policy and label clearly.
