### 5.2.1 systemd services and timers
- Where it lives
  - System units: `/etc/systemd/system/`
  - Vendor baseline units: `/lib/systemd/system/` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`
  - User units: `~/.config/systemd/user/`
- What to look for
  - New or modified unit files in `/etc/systemd/system/`
  - `ExecStart=` pointing to user-writable paths (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, home dirs)
  - Paired `*.timer` + `*.service` for periodic execution
  - Obfuscation (base64 decode, curl|bash patterns, long one-liners)
  - Unusual targets in `WantedBy=` (unexpected auto-start behavior)
- Verification moves (avoid executing unknown binaries)
  - `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --type=timer`
  - `systemctl status <unit>`
  - `systemctl cat <unit>`

### 5.2.2 cron and anacron scheduling
- Where it lives
  - System crontab: `/etc/crontab`
  - Drop-in jobs: `/etc/cron.d/`
  - Periodic directories: `/etc/cron.hourly/`, `/etc/cron.daily/`, `/etc/cron.weekly/`, `/etc/cron.monthly/`
  - User crontabs (distro dependent): `/var/spool/cron/` or `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/`
- What to look for
  - New entries with `@reboot` or unusually tight intervals
  - Commands that fetch or execute remote content (`curl`, `wget`, `nc`, `bash -c`)
  - Encoded/obfuscated commands (base64, excessive quoting)
  - New scripts placed into cron.* directories that do not match admin baselines

### 5.2.3 legacy init persistence (SysVinit, Upstart, rc scripts)
- Where it lives
  - SysV init scripts: `/etc/init.d/`
  - Runlevel links: `/etc/rc*.d/`
  - Upstart jobs (older Ubuntu): `/etc/init/`
- What to look for
  - Newly created scripts in `/etc/init.d/` or new symlinks in `/etc/rc*.d/`
  - Jobs that start networking tools, reverse shells, or download-and-execute chains
  - Service names mimicking legitimate daemons with subtle typos

### 5.2.4 shell startup and user profile execution
- Where it lives
  - Bash: `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_logout`
  - Zsh: `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile`
  - Global: `/etc/profile`, `/etc/bash.bashrc`, `/etc/zsh/zshrc`
- What to look for
  - New lines that execute scripts/binaries on login or shell start
  - PATH manipulation that prioritizes user-writable directories
  - Aliases/functions that wrap common commands to hide output or redirect execution
  - Sourcing hidden files from home directories (dotfiles with random names)

### 5.2.5 SSH persistence and remote access footholds
- Where it lives
  - User keys: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (and root equivalents)
  - SSH daemon config: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`
- What to look for
  - New keys for privileged accounts or unknown key comments
  - Config changes that weaken auth (PermitRootLogin, PasswordAuthentication)
  - Unexpected `ForceCommand` directives or Match blocks
  - New users added specifically for SSH access

### 5.2.6 service configuration hooks and application-level persistence
- Where it lives (varies by service)
  - General configs: `/etc/`
  - Nginx: `/etc/nginx/`
  - Apache: `/etc/apache2/` or `/etc/httpd/`
  - Common custom installs: `/usr/local/`
- What to look for
  - New site configs/modules loading unknown binaries or shared objects
  - Startup scripts that call external interpreters with inline code
  - Unexpected listen ports, new virtual hosts, or proxy rules that route traffic oddly
  - Daemons running under unexpected users or from non-standard paths

### 5.2.7 kernel module and boot-time load persistence (higher impact)
- Where it lives
  - Module load lists: `/etc/modules`, `/etc/modules-load.d/`
  - Modprobe configs: `/etc/modprobe.d/`
- What to look for
  - New modules set to load at boot without a clear admin reason
  - Blacklisting security-relevant modules or enabling unusual drivers
  - Suspicious `.ko` files in module directories (validate provenance carefully)

### 5.2.8 high-signal triage heuristics (quick filters)
- High-risk execution paths
  - Transient: `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, `/run`
  - Suspicious "blend-in" paths: hidden dirs in home (`~/.cache/.<name>`), odd files in `/usr/local/bin/`
- Behavior indicators
  - Download-and-execute chains
  - Encoded payload staging (base64 blobs, hex, gzip+base64)
  - Newly modified persistence artifacts near the suspected intrusion timeframe
