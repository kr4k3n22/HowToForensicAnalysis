Note: i don't think we're gonna get memory dumps
### 8.1.1 Install/verify Python requirements (Windows)
- Goal: run Volatility 3 with a clean, repeatable Python environment.
- Prefer Python 3.10 or 3.11 for best compatibility.
- Verify Python is installed and on PATH
```powershell
python --version
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
````

- Create a dedicated virtual environment (recommended)
    

```powershell
cd C:\tools
python -m venv vol3-venv
.\vol3-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

- Install Volatility 3
    
    - Option A: install from pip (simplest)
        

```powershell
pip install volatility3
vol -h
```

- Option B: run from a local folder (if you keep tools offline)
    

```powershell
cd C:\tools
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git
cd volatility3
pip install -r requirements.txt
python vol.py -h
```

### 8.1.2 Organize paths (keep cases clean)

- Put memory images under the case folder (evidence stays separate from outputs)
    
    - Example:
        
        - `C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw`
            
        - `C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\`
            
- Create a log/output directory
    

```powershell
mkdir C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility -Force
```

### 8.1.3 First run: confirm the image is readable (quick sanity checks)

- Identify OS/kernel info (fast "does this work" check)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.info > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\windows_info.txt"
```

- List processes (if this fails, stop and fix symbols/format before going deeper)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.pslist > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\pslist.txt"
```

### 8.1.4 Core workflows (most-used plugins)

- Process list and suspicious process triage
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.pslist > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\pslist.txt"
```

- Process tree (parent/child relationships)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.pstree > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\pstree.txt"
```

- Command lines (how a process was launched)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.cmdline > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\cmdline.txt"
```

- DLL/module review (what a process loaded)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.dlllist > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\dlllist.txt"
```

- Network artifacts (support varies by Windows version/capture type)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.netscan > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\netscan.txt"
```

- Registry hives present in memory (useful for pivoting)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" windows.registry.hivelist > "C:\cases\CASE123\logs\volatility\hivelist.txt"
```

### 8.1.5 Targeted pivots (when you find a bad PID)

- Dump a process (only after you decide you need a binary for deeper analysis)
    

```powershell
mkdir C:\cases\CASE123\exports\mem_dumps -Force
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" -o "C:\cases\CASE123\exports\mem_dumps" windows.psdump --pid 1234
```

- Dump a DLL from a specific process (when a suspicious module stands out)
    

```powershell
vol -f "C:\cases\CASE123\evidence\memory\mem.raw" -o "C:\cases\CASE123\exports\mem_dumps" windows.dlllist --pid 1234
```

- After dumping, hash what you export
    

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\cases\CASE123\exports\mem_dumps" -Recurse -File |
  Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 |
  Sort-Object Path |
  Out-File "C:\cases\CASE123\hashes\mem_dumps_sha256.txt"
```

### 8.1.6 Common kinks (the stuff that breaks first)

- "No suitable address space" / plugin outputs are empty
    
    - Likely causes: unsupported capture format, truncated capture, wrong plugin family, or symbol mismatch.
        
    - Fix: run `windows.info` first and confirm it produces sane output.
        
- Symbols problems (most common on newer Windows builds)
    
    - Symptoms: nonsense output, missing fields, or plugins failing unexpectedly.
        
    - Fix approach:
        
        - Ensure you are running a current Volatility 3 build.
            
        - If the VM is offline, you may need to stage symbol files through an approved method.
            
- Crash dumps vs raw memory
    
    - Small dumps often lack userland artifacts (process details, cmdlines, sockets).
        
    - Kernel-only dumps reduce visibility for user processes and network context.
        
    - Expect fewer results and treat "not found" as "not observed."
        
- Netscan limitations
    
    - `windows.netscan` success depends on OS version and capture completeness.
        
    - If netscan is sparse, corroborate with disk/network logs instead of forcing conclusions.
        
- Performance and time
    
    - Large images on slow storage make plugins look "hung."
        
    - Put the memory file on fast SSD storage and avoid scanning over network shares.
        
- Overinterpreting plugin output
    
    - Volatility gives indicators, not final truth.
        
    - Upgrade confidence only when you correlate with disk artifacts (paths, persistence, event logs).
        

### 8.1.7 Minimal runbook (fast triage order)

- `windows.info`
    
- `windows.pslist`
    
- `windows.pstree`
    
- `windows.cmdline`
    
- `windows.netscan` (if supported)
    
- `windows.dlllist` (focused on suspicious PIDs)
    
- Dump only what you can justify and hash everything you export
